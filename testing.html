    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <main>
        <p>This page will inform the user of how I have optimised and tested my website.</p>
        <h3>Optimisation</h3>
        <ul id="optimisationList">
            <li>Formatting - I try to make my HTML and CSS file consistently indented so it is easier to manipulate and read</li><br>
            <li>Use of variables - Instead of altering all general elemetns, I use classes and Id's so I can manipulate my elements to how I would like them to look specifically, giving me mroe control</li><br>
            <li>Class and ID naming - I give my elements names which relate to their purpose, instead of abstract names like "x" and "y"</li><br>
            <li>Avoiding bad practice - I have not used attributes like !important in my html, and instead used correct specificity</li><br>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraphContainer">
        <h3>Debugging</h3>
        <p>I used HTML and CSS validators to make sure my code was sound. In my legal and security page, I have linked the exact ones I used.</p>
        <p>Upon checking, all my css was valid, however during debugging my HTML there were a few common issues that occured over my html:</p>
        <ul id="debugList">
          <li>Unclosed tags</li>
          <li>Stray end tags</li>
          <li>Incorrect attributes in elements</li>
          <li>Incorrect indentation</li>
          <li>Child elements not allowed in parent element</li>
          <li>Duplicate ID's</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After debugging, I corrected all my code to account for these errors.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="paragraphContainer">
        <h3>Browser Testing</h3>
        <p>To ensure consistent experiences, I conducted tests on popular platforms including Edge, Chrome, and Firefox.</p>
        <p>For adjustments and to assess responsiveness on mobile and narrow devices, I used Microsoft Developer Tools, allowing me to simulate various screen resolutions.</p>
        <p>During the testing phase, I gave attention to the behavior of CSS grids, ensuring responsiveness across different resolutions and browsers.</p>
        <p>In addition, I examined text and image scaling to maintain clarity and visibility, ensuring a visually appealing presentation on the webpage regardless of the user's device or browser choice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphContainer">
      <h3>Accessibility Testing</h3>
      <p>I used the WAVE browser extension to make sure my browser is accessible. I had 1 error on my contact page, where my submit button did not have a contrasting border and blended in with the background. After ammending this my page had no errors, ensuring it was accessible.</p>
