    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <main>
      <p>This page aims to inform the user of how decisions have been made when creating the website to ensure that it is friendly to all users.</p>

        <h2>Accessibility Statement</h2>
        <p>We are dedicated to making sure that everyone, including those with disabilities, can access our website. Our constant goal is to satisfy the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines so that all users can have a good experience.</p>
        <h3>Key Accessibility Features</h3>
        <ul id="accessibilityList">
          <li>Our website is designed with a responsive layout to ensure usability on various devices and screen sizes.</li>
          <li>We have implemented a high-contrast color scheme with a light white background and dark gray text to enhance readability for those with vision impairments.</li>
          <li>For those who cannot see the photos properly or for those who are using the browser's "read-aloud" feature, each image has descriptive alt text.</li>
          <li>When hovered over or tapped, interactive components, including photos, enlarge and become easier to see.</li>
          <li>Links and contact details have increased in size and change color for improved readability.</li>
          <li>Longer lists utilize bullet points to make it clear where one element ends and another starts, aiding users with cognitive disabilities.</li>
          <li>Complimentary colors are used for the background with dark and lighter elements to emphasize text and vital page elements.</li>
          <li>Easy readability is achieved by using a readable sans-serif typeface.</li>
          <li>For the quiz aspect, both color cues and text cues ,"incorrect" and "correct", are provided to accommodate users with different visual capabilities.</li>
          <li>The CSS uses media queries to change items so they may be read more easily on smaller screens.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Assistive Technologies</h3>
        <p>We understand the importance of compatibility with assistive technologies. Our website is tested and optimized for use with common screen readers, magnifiers, and voice recognition software.</p>
